TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)

This repository contains an implementation of the TOPSIS method, a popular multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique.
TOPSIS helps in ranking alternatives based on their distance from the ideal solution (best) and the negative-ideal solution (worst).

🚀 Features

Implementation of TOPSIS in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Handles decision matrices with multiple alternatives and criteria.

Supports weighted and normalized decision matrices.

Provides a step-by-step breakdown of:

Normalization of data

Weighted normalized decision matrix

Identification of ideal best and ideal worst solutions

Calculation of separation measures

Calculation of relative closeness to ideal solution

Final ranking of alternatives

🧠 Applications

Supplier selection

Project prioritization

Performance evaluation

Financial decision-making

Resource allocation
